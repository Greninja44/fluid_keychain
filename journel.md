# June 15 Morning : Got the screen to work!
I did some research abt the pendant , i learnt about imu( inertial measurement unit) which basically gives us gyroscopic and accelro values which we calculate and get the position of the body.
using the gyro we integrate with an esp32 s3( we need wifi and bluetooth also to control it) ,   **instead of pendant how abt a keychain**
