## FLUID KEYchain
A interactive RGB matrix keychain built using the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Matrix (8x8 RGB) that simulates fluid motion, displays emojis, text, and animations, and even runs a simple game!
keychain inspired by Mitxela’s video. I'm using the Waveshare ESP32-S3 RGB board to handle the LED matrix animations.I'm making a simple charger circuit that includes a 3.7 V Li-Ion charging module and a 5 V boost converter to power the ESP32 board. The goal is to keep things modular and easy to swap parts if needed.
The whole setup will be packed into a small custom 3D-printed case with a power switch and USB-C charging. It's portable, rechargeable, and glows like magic in your pocket.
